# Environment Variables Setup for Admin Authentication

## Required Environment Variables

To secure your BiblioKit admin access, you need to set up the following environment variables in your Netlify deployment:

### 1. Admin Credentials

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
```

## Setting Up in Netlify

### Option 1: Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
3. Click **Add variable** and add:
   - **Variable name**: `ADMIN_EMAIL`
   - **Value**: Your admin email address
4. Click **Add variable** again and add:
   - **Variable name**: `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - **Value**: Your secure admin password (use a strong password!)

### Option 2: Netlify CLI
```bash
# Login to Netlify CLI
netlify login

# Set environment variables
netlify env:set ADMIN_EMAIL "your-email@domain.com"
netlify env:set ADMIN_PASSWORD "your-secure-password"
```

## Security Best Practices

### Password Requirements
- **Minimum 12 characters**
- Include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special characters
- Don't use common words or personal information

### Example Strong Password
```
MySecure2024!Admin@BiblioKit
```

## After Setting Variables

1. **Redeploy your site** to apply the new environment variables
2. **Test the login** using the üîí button on your live site
3. **Verify security** by trying to access the editor without logging in

## How It Works

- The üîí button appears for non-authenticated users
- Click it to open the admin login form
- Enter your `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- Once authenticated, the ‚úèÔ∏è edit button and üö™ logout button appear
- The content editor is now protected and only accessible to you

## Troubleshooting

### Login Not Working?
1. Check that environment variables are set correctly in Netlify
2. Ensure you redeployed after setting variables
3. Verify there are no typos in email/password
4. Check browser console for error messages

### Can't See Admin Buttons?
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try in an incognito/private window
3. Check that JavaScript is enabled

## Next Steps

Once authentication is working:
- Consider implementing content database storage
- Add content versioning and backup
- Set up admin dashboard for better management
